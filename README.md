# Artificial-Life-Simulations

My personal experiments in the field of aritificial life simulations. 

CAUTION: Some of the modules present here are outdated and not in their most updated form.

1. Beehive Simulation and Optimization: Simulated an environment with food sources, beehives containing bees (finite state machines) and a day-night cycle, and performed optimization over parameters of the beehive (gradient descent).

NOTE: Ported this project to MATLAB. Will be commiting those modules soon.

2. Langton's Ant: Langton's Ant is a beautiful example of how simple rules can give rise to complex behaviour. This module is an attempt at modelling this automaton and try to replicate the results obtained regarding its behaviour.

NOTE: This is largely incomplete, though I hope to complete it soon.
